At the moment, Binance DEX only supports [Limit Orders](https://www.binance.vision/tutorials/what-is-a-limit-order).

You can use the "Best [Ask](https://www.binance.vision/glossary/asking-price)" to input the minimum price that you can currently buy for.<br/>
You use the "Best [Bid](https://www.binance.vision/glossary/bid-price)" to input the highest price that you can currently sell for.

* "Price" - The number of tokens per token that you are willing to buy / sell for. "Price" can only be changed with "Tick Size". For $ONE, the tick size is 0.00000001
* "Amount" the number of tokens you wish to buy / sell. "Amount" can only be changed with "Lot Size". For $ONE, the lot size is 10.
* "25% / 50% / 75% / 100%" This will allocate the selected percentage of your funds to either be sold or used to buy.

For example on the buy side if you want to buy 100$ONE and your limit price is 0.0006625. Then, the total notional for this order is 0.06625.
